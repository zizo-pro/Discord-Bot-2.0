The slash module for this libary

- - -

Here is everything about slashcommmands.
You shouldn't need to import this module unless you really now what you're doing. 

The only thing you might wanna import is `.ext`, but you can import that from `discord_ui.ext`.
Everything else here could only be needed for intellisense.
